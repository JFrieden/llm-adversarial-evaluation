Jailbreaks.py 

In this file we write functions to help generate attacks for models that we 
query using client applications like chatgpt.com and claude.ai


For report: Different model types need to be explained, eval against open vs. closed, identify which prompts work for which models
there are fifty prompts in github repo to find... (Claude + Llama + Bart are good other models)
